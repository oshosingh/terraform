We create a web server EC2 instance with terraform.

Problem: It is only an EC2 instance, it does not have any software installed.

Provisioners are used to execute scripts on a local or remote machine as part of resource
creation or destruction.


provisioner.tf *

resource "aws_instance" "myec2" {
    ami = "image",
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
    key_name = "terraform"
    
    provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
        "sudo amazon-linux-extras install 0y nginx1.12"
        "sudo systemctl start nginx"
    ]
    
    connection {
        type = "ssh"
        host = self.public_ip
        user = "ec2-user"
        private_key = "${file("./terraform.pem")}"
    }
}
}
