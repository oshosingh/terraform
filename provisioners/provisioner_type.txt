Terraform has capability to turn provisioners both at the time of resource creation as well as destruction.

There are two main types of provisioner:
1. Local Exec
2. Remote Exec
3. etc. (see docs)

local-exec provisioner allow us to invoke local executable after resource is created

provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo ${aws_instance.web.private-ip} >> private_ips.txt"
}

**** local exec can be used to run ansible-playbooks
