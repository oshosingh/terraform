You have created a new resource via terraform.
Users have made a lot of manual changes(bot infrastructure and inside the server)
Two ways to deal with this: Import the changes to terraform / Delete and Recreate the resource

The terraform taint command manually marks a terraform managed resource as tainted, forcing it to
be destroyed and recreated on the next apply

> command = terraform taint resource_name.local_resource_name
> terraform import to get the current state of resource


---------------------------------------------
1. This command will not modify infra, but does modify the state file in order to mark a 
   resource as tainted.
   
2. Once a resource is marked as tainted, the next plan will show that the resource will be
   destroyed and recreated and the next apply will implement this change.
   
3. Note that tainting a resource for recreation may affect resources that depend on the newly
   tainted resource.
   
   For e.g., ec2 instance gets a new ip when recreated then if their is a dns resource then 
             it should be updated to point to the new ip.
