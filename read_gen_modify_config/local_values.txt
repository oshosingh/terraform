Important Points for Local Values
1. Local values can be helpful to avoid repeating the same values or expressions multiple time in a configuration.
2. If overused they can also make a configuration hard to read by future maintainers by hiding the actual values used.
3. Use local values only in moderation, in situations where a single value or result is used in many places and that value
   is likely to be changed in future.


locals {
    common_tags = {
        owner = "Devops Team"
        service = "backend"
    }
} 

resource "aws_instance" "app-deb"{
    ami = "image"
    type = "t2.micro"
    tags = local.common_tags
}

resource "aws_ebs_volume" "db_ebs" { 
    availability_zone = "us-west-2a"
    size = 8
    tags = local.common_tags
}


Local values support for Expression *

Local Values can be used for multiple different use-cases like having a conditional expression

locals {
    name_prefix = "${var.name != "" ? var.name : var.default }"
}
