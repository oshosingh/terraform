The count parameter on resource can simplify configurations and let you scale resources by simply
incrementing a number.

resource "aws_instance" "instance-1" {
    ami = "image"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
    count = 3
}

In resource blocks where count is set, an additional count object is available in expressions, so you can
modify the configuration of each instance.

This object has one attr:
count.index = The distinct index number (starting with 0) corresponding to this instance

resource "aws_instance" "instance" {
    ami = "image"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
    count = 3
    name: var.instance_name[count.index]
}


Give nice names when working with count :

variable "instance_name" {
    type = list
    default = ["dev", "stage", "prod"]
}
