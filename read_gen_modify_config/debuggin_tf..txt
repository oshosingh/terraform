Terraform has detailed logs which can be enabled by setting the TF_LOG environment variable to
any value.

You can set TF_LOG to one of the log levels TRACE,DEBUG,INFO,WARN,ERROR to change the verbosity of the
logs.

TRACE is the most verbose and it is the default if TF_LOG is set to something other than a 
log level name.

To persist logged output you can set TF_LOG_PATH in order to force the log to always be appended
to a specific file when logging is enabled.

export TF_LOG = TRACE (visible on console)
export TF_LOG_pATH = /tmp/terraform-crash.log (store logs in a file)
