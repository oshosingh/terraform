Data sources allow data to be fetched or computed for use elsewhere in Terrform configuration.

> AWS ami id change based on region, update etc, so for such cases data sources are a good option.

data "aws_ami" "app_ami" {
    most_recent = true
    owners = ["amazon"]
    
    filter {
        name = "name"
        values = ["amzn2-ami-hvm*"]
    }
}

resource "aws_instance" "instance-1" {
    ami = data.aws_ami.app_ami.id
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
