The Terraform language includes a number of built-in-functions that you can use to transform and combine values.
The general syntax for function calls is a function name followed by comma-separated arguments in parentheses.

function(argument1, argument2)
> max(1,2,3) = 3

The Terraform language does not support user-defined functions, and so only the functions built in tot the 
language are available for use:

- Numeric
- String
- Collections
- Encoding
- Filesystem
- Date and Time
- Hash and Crypto
- IP Network
- Type Conversion
