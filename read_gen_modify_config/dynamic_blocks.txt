challengge: 
In many of the use-cases, there are repeatable nested blocks that needs to be defined.
This can lead to a long code and it can be difficult to manage in a longer time.

Dynamic Blocks:
Dynamic block allows us to dynamically construct repeatable nested blocks which is supported inside
resource, data, provider, and provisioner blocks.


variable "sg_ports" {
    type: list(number)
    description: "list of ingress ports"
    default = [8000,8001,8002,8003]
}

resource "aws_security_group" "dynamicsg" {
    name = "dynamic-sg"
    description = "ingress"
    
    dynamic "ingress" {
        for_each = var.sg_ports
        iterator = port  # define iterator and use, default is label of dynamic block
        content {
            from_port = ingress.value (port.value)
            to_port = ingress.value
            protocol = "tcp"
            cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
        }
    }
}
