With organization managing their entire infrastructure in terraform, it is likely that you will see some
sensitive information embedded in the code.

When working with a field that contains information likely to be considered sensitive, it is best to set the
Sensitive property on its schema to true.

locals{
    db_password {
        admin = "password"
    } 
}

output "db_password" {
    value = local.db_password
    sensitive = true
}
