  Terraform stores the state of the infrastructure that is being created 
  from the TF files.
  
  This state allows terraform to map real world resource to your existing config.
  
  -> terraform.tfstate file is stored in the root of terraform project.
  
  
Desired and current state *
 
 Desired -> Terraform's primary function is to create, modify and destroy infrastructure resources to match the desired state described in a terraform configuration
 
 Current -> Current state is the actual state of a resource that is currently deployed. Terraform tries to ensure that the deployed infrastructure is based on the desired state.
